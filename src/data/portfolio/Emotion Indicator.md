title: "Emotion Indicator"

Emojis are a product of information technology. In the age of letters and telegrams there was no emoji; it was with the invention of Unicode that emojis became a possible thing, and it was with the spread of Internet that emojis became popular. Emojis are special in that:

1. They are concise and direct;
2. They transcend national borders.

As a computerscience student, I am interested in how computer scientists shape popular culture with their inventions, and wish to explore how to take advantage of this culture to further advance computer science. This device is a prototype for a **mood indicator**, using emojis to show the wearerâ€™s mood. Consider a world of AR when everyone has such an emoji over his/her head; it would be much easier for people to get how each other feels and would act accordingly. The inspiration for making it wearable is video games; in multi-player games each player would have a bar above his/her head showing the name, level, health, and other info. There would be no level or health in the real world, but having a mood indicator in that position seems a good choice.

When I was wearing this device aroung the campus, I collected feedback from my fellow calssmates. Some (useful) feedback include:

1. We have already been expressing moods with emojis on social media such as Facebook, but people would not immediately know how the people are feeling without reading that status;

2. This could be used as an animal/pet mood indicator to further relationship between human and animals;

3. If everyone wore this device on an exam, would someone pretend to be self-confident in order to terrorize other students? This question about deception was also talked about in the critique, and I believe this can be an excellent opportunity for social experiments.
